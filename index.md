### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct amount of points someone has. Calculating when it's someone's
    turn and if they receive any bonus points. This is a lab I'll never forget.
* Lab 12

    Lab 12 part 1 was very challenging but still one of my favorites. Controlling how colors changed, images rising or using different files to communicate with each other in a complex way was very challenging. But doable. Which is why it'll always be one of my favorites.

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 will always hold a place in my heart. Exposing me to the world of coding, using cin and cout statements whilst understanding main functions for the first time. I liked it very much.
